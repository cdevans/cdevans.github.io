This is the source code for [cdevans.github.io](https://cdevans.github.io), my personal site and blog.

The site is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and uses the dark skin of a slightly modified [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. Theme modifications can be found in the [_includes](_includes) and [assets/css](assets/css) folders.
