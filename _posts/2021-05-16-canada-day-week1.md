I have signed up for a 10K virtual race on Canada Day. To prepare, I intend to work primarily on speed. I've realized exactly how much I dread heading out for longer runs, since I'm so slow and they take up so much time. It doesn't help just how quickly I get bored on those runs either! To help with this, for the foreseeable future I plan to do two shorter runs each weekday, and one longer run on the weekend. Weekday morning runs will generally be focused on speed work, pushing the pace with tempo or fartlek workouts, and weekday afternoon/evening runs will generally be at slower paces or run/walk intervals. The weekend run will be done at a slower pace with run/walk intervals (10&1 for the most part), regardless of distance.

I hope that this plan will allow me to keep up a decent training volume, but will ultimately bring my average pace back to a more reasonable value!
