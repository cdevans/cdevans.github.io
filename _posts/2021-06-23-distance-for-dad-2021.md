Today is my father's 80th birthday. For approximately one quarter of those years, he has been battling Parkinson's disease, although it was not officially diagnosed until 2004. For the most part, he was able to manage the physical effects of the disease relatively well. Unfortunately, however, both the physical symptoms and the dementia that all too often accompanies Parkinson's progressed agressively through late 2019 and early 2020, to the point where he had to be moved to a full-care facility in early March 2020.

Here of some photos of Dad taken over the past decade.

Back in January, I challenged myself to run a total of 1,700 kilometres by the end of 2021, 100 kilometres for each of the 17 years since Dad's diagnosis. While I will miss mid-year by a few days, I am on track to pass the half-way point sometime in early July, and at my current training volume I will reach the distance goal in late October or early November.

Today, I'm taking the challenge one step further, and turning it into a fundraising effort for Parkinson's research. As such, I have joined [Team Fox](https://www.michaeljfox.org/teamfox), the grassroots community fundraising arm of the [Micheal J. Fox Foundation](https://www.michaeljfox.org/). One hundred percent of the funds raised by Team Fox members goes directly to research programs dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease.

If you are able, I respectfully request that you to donate to the [Distance for Dad](https://fundraise.michaeljfox.org/tf-2021/distance-for-dad) campaign and help me support essential Parkinson's research. Thanks in advance for your support!
