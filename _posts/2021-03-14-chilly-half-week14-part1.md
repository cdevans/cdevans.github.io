#### Run Log

- Tue: 6K tempo ==> 5.90K @ 8:29 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1702711160))
- Thu: 6K farlek (as 1min fast, 2min steady) ==> 6.06K @ 9:04 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1703957968))

This week ended up being a bit of a wash. My hip was really bothering me, so I pushed the Wednesday (6K fartlek) run until Thursday, and really struggled through it. After that, I felt that I should rest the hip rather than putting more stress on it, so took the rest of the week off. I plan to repeat the entire week's schedule next week, pushing the race date out yet another week.

#### Total Distance: 11.96K
