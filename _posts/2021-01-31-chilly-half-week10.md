A snowstorm on Tuesday made for treacherous conditions, so I spread that distance (4K) over the other two shorter runs instead. Yet again, I had to swap the Wednesday (12.5K with hill repeats) and Thursday (6K steady) runs due to work obligations.

This has been my best overall week in quite some time, as I achieved new personal records in distance, duration, and calories burned according to my Runkeeper statistics!
