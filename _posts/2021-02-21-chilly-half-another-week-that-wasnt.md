#### Run Log

- Wed: 7K steady ==> 7.02K @ 9:03 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1689131335))

Weather and work conspired against me again this week. A storm on Tuesday forced me to skip that run (5K tempo), and then due to meeting schedules I had to do the Thursday run (7K steady) on Wednesday and save the longer (15K with hill repeats) for Thursday.  But then more bad weather made me miss the re-scheduled hill repeats. At that point, I decided to scrap the rest of the week (my hip had been acting up a bit anyways, so the extra rest is probably worth it), and repeat Week 12 next week. This will push the training schedule out another week, so now race day is April 4th.

#### Total Distance: 7.02K
