Extreme heat and humidity messed with the schedule this week. I ended up skipping the Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon runs because it was just too hot to be running. After missing both of those runs, I opted to do a single 7K run each of Thursday and Friday, and then do a longer run on the weekend to make up the distance.
