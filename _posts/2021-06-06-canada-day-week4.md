I increased the distance of the weekday afternoon runs to 5K this week. However, the schedule didn't exactly go as planned! I had to shorten the Tuesday afternoon run due to work and family scheduling, and due to extreme heat and humidity on Thursday, I opted to skip the afternoon run. However, I made up for the distance over the remainder of the week.
