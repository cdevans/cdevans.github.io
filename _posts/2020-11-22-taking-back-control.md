The lockdown and quarantine methods implemented locally to control COVID-19 have had a detrimental effect on my overall health. Without swimming or curling, and not even having the short walk from the subway/streetcar to the office, exercise became an afterthought. The extent of the excerise I've been getting lately has been walking the dog. As a result, I've seen my weight spiral even more out of control than it has been in the last couple years.

In an effort to at least maintain some semblance of shape, early in the summer I bought and installed TRX bands at home, and I started running again. For a few weeks, everything went well, but then while out for a run one evening in early August, I tripped and injured my knee quite serverly. By the time it healed enough that I could move well enough to do TRX workouts or run again, I'd gotten out of the habit, and getting back into a routine proved difficult. Getting back into the pool helped somewhat, but swimming only two times a week just wasn't enough. And now the second lockdown has put an end to even that small bit of exercise.

Today, I have decided to take back control. The last time I had decent success with weight loss and maintaining an adequate exercise routine was when I was half-marathon training. So, I have signed up for the (virtual) [Chilly Half Marathon](https://www.chillyhalfmarathon.ca/) in March. I am also committing to tracking my calories properly and regularly using the [Lose It!](https://loseit.com/) app.

This week, I start an 18-week training program leading up to the Chilly Half. I have based the program I will be following around the [Running Room](https://www.runningroom.com/ca/) training plan I used for previous half marathons, adjusted for the fact that I am much slower than I used to be! For the most part, the program consists of five runs per week: Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are shorter runs, Wednesdays are gradually increasing distance and incorporate either hill or speed workouts as the schedule progresses, and Sundays are long distance runs done at a slower pace and as run/walk combos.

To keep myself motivated and on track, I will be posting weekly summaries of my training here, and all of my runs are tracked using [Runkeeper&trade;](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/profile).

My goal for the race is simply to complete the distance, but I will be very happy if I can do it in three hours.
