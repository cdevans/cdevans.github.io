I haven't been very good about training since completing the Chilly Half. I had set up a plan for each of the last three weeks that kept me runnning 40-50K per week, all while working on speed. However, as the saying goes, the best laid plans often go awry!

In total, I only managed to do five runs over the course of the past three weeks. While I did meet my time/pace goals in most of them, needless to say I have to be more diligent going forward if I expect to see continued improvement!
