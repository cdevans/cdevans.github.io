Week 3:

- Tue: 4K tempo ==> 4.04K @ 8:53 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1647580952))
- Sun: 7K run/walk ==> 15.02K @ 9:44 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1650170722))

I threw out my back early in the week, and wasn't able to run Wednesday (3K tempo), Thursday (4K steady), or Saturday (3K steady). However, I was feeling much better on Sunday, so I ran extra distance to make up for some of the missed runs.

Total Distance: 19.06K
