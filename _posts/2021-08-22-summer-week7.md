Well, this wasn't quite the full week I'd hoped. It turns out that not running for four weeks has some negative influence on muscles! After two 4K runs on Monday (plus a TRX workout over the previous weekend), I was extremely sore when I woke up on Tuesday. I skipped the morning run, but added an extra kilometre to the afternoon run. Extreme heat and humidity set in again on Wednesday, making running difficult, if not unbearable. I managed to get an early-morning run in on Wednesday, and toughed it out Thursday afternoon (albeit at a very slow pace), but even those were a challenge as temperatures remained extremely high with high humidity right through the days and nights. I ended up not running Friday or on the weekend due to continued heat warnings.
