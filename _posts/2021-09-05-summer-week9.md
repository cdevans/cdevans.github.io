I managed to get back into the swing of things this week, for the most part. After two runs on Monday, I was pretty sore and tired, so took Tuesday off, but made up a good part of the distance over the Wednesday to Friday runs. I did skip out on the Thursday afternoon run, though, due to a combination of work commitments and some aching leg muscles. Friday afternoon I felt great at the 5K mark, so just kept going, and ended up putting in 10K total, which I haven't done in a while. With that, my weekly total was almost back over the 45K mark, so I decided to rest for the weekend and aim for another increase next week!
