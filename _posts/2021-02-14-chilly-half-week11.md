I got off to a good start this week, only to have it derail a bit. Due to a combination of work, soreness, and weather, I wasn't able to get out for the Thursday (7K steady) run, or even postpone it a day and go Friday. It all came back together on the weekend, though. On Saturday, I hit the 5K mark and was feeling great, so I just kept going, putting in an extra 4K. On Sunday, I miscalculated my route somewhat, and when I hit the 16K mark I still had a fair distance to get home, so I decided to run it out to the three hour mark and see how far that got me. In all, I missed very little of the distance that was supposed to be done.
