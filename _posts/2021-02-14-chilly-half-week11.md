Got off to a good start this week, only to have it derail a bit. Due to a combination of work, soreness, and weather, I wasn't able to get out for the Thursday run (7K steady), or even postpone it a day and go Friday. It all came back together on the weekend, though. Saturday, I hit the 5K mark and was feeling great, so I just kept going and put in an extra 4K. Then on Sunday, I miscalculated the route a bit and still had quite a way to go by the time I hit the 16K mark, so I decided to run it out to the three hour mark and see how far that got me. In all, I missed very little of the distance that was supposed to be done.

#### Total Distance: 46.4K
