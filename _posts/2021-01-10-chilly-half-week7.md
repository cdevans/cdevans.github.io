This was a bit of a crazy week work-wise, and I had to shuffle things around a bit, shifting the Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday runs by a day, swapping the Thursday (5K steady) and Saturday (3K steady) runs, and then ultimately skipping Saturday. Did a bit extra on Sunday to make up for some of it, though. Thought I'd struggle with the hill repeats, but it actually turned out to be a rather fun workout!

#### Total Distance: 27.03K
