A post last week didn't seem appropriate, since I only managed to run a whopping 10K over the course of week. Life just got in the way, with back to school, back to swimming, and visiting out-of-town relatives. Adjusting to new schedules and a plethora of extended family gatherings made it a challenge to get in any quality running time.

I did, however, mangage to get in most of the planned distance this past week. There were still some adjustments necessary due to continued family gatherings, as well as school and swimming scheduling, but it turned out to be a good week for the most part. The extra distance put in on Tuesday morning combined with a lack of food intake throughout the day made the afternoon run a challenge. I hit the wall at the 5K mark (of an intended 7K), so I stopped and reset to doing 1-1s to get back home. I had some trouble with the interval settings, though, and ended up with the two logs for that short, very slow, distance! Other than that, all the runs went quite well.

Additionally, it is fantastic to be back in the pool. We're slowly easing back into both full practice distance and pool schedule, but even to be back twice a week is such a blessing!
