Well, that didn't last long. I've had a horrible three weeks of training (both running and swimming), with Thanksgiving, my birthday, running two swim meets, curling restarting, pool closures, and crazy busy work and family schedules, not to mention some rather nasty weather. As such, I am now very much in jeopardy of not making my goal. Well, more realistically, making the goal distance has become an overly optimistic endeavour, given I would have to average better than 60K per week for the remainder of the year, and I've been strugging to get over 40K per week over the last couple months. I will still strive to get as close to the goal distance as I can, however.
