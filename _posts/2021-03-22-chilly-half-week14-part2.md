A strange schedule this week, due to many factors. I had been planning to re-do the entire Week 14 schedule as it should have been done last week, but that didn't quite work out!

Since my hip was still hurting, I took an extra day off and did the scheduled Tuesday run (6K tempo) on Wednesday. A crazy work day on Thursday resulted in no run, and so I did the originally scheduled Wednesday run (6K fartlek) on Friday. I managed a really good overal pace, and felt great at the end of that run, so I tacked on a second run at a slower pace, putting in half of the distance of the originally scheduled Thursday run (8K steady). On Saturday, I did the originally scheduled run (6K steady), and tacked on the remaining 4K from the missed run. Sunday was Gretchen's birthday, so I postponed the long run until Monday to spend more of the day with the family.

#### Total Distance: 44.31K
