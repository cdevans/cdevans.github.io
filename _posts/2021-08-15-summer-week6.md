Over the past four weeks, I have only managed to get in eight runs. Amongst getting sick, breaking a toe, and extreme heat and humidity, I haven't been good about keeping up the training. That will change starting tomorrow, however, as I get back to my regular training schedule! I can still complete my challenge with a little perseverence.
