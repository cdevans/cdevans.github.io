Still being sore from all the yard work over the weekend, I decided to swap the Tuesday (10K) and Wednesday (6K) runs, and then ultimately postponed the Wednesday run until Thursday and skipped the Saturday (3K steady) run.

The race run went well. I managed to finish the distance faster than what I did two weeks ago, and I even got close to my (revised) stretch goal of 3:15! Overall, I'm happy with the progress I've made training for this race, and I feel that I've earned the medal.

I've also come to find that I'm enjoying running again, and am looking forward to keeping up the distance, hopefully getting faster at the same time!

#### Total Distance: 37.18K
