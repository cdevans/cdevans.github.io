The extreme heat and humidity continued this week, forcing a change of schedule. Rather than two shorter runs each weekday, I revised my plan to run one longer (7K) run per day, with the intention of going very early morning to get the run in before the heat/humidity got too crazy. The plan was also to keep the 10K LSD on the weekend. For the most part, this plan worked out. However, when I got up on Wednesday morning (6:30), the temperature was already over 30 degrees with humidity pushing it closer to 40, so I skipped that run. The weekend faced a similar fate, with extreme heat and humidity warnings being issued each day, along with severe thunderstorm watches both days, so I skipped that run too. All in all, not the best week, but I still managed to get in a bit of distance. On the plus side, the weekend rain seems to have cut through the humidity, and the forecast looks promising for more seasonal temperatures in the days to come!
