This was an extremely light week. Because I was scheduled to volunteer at Swimming Canada's Olympic Trials this week, I had juggled the schedule in such a way that I would still cover my usual distance. However, that plan fell apart when my ongoing issues with neck and shoulder pain/strain resurfaced. I took Tuesday, and then tried running again Wednesday morning. Unfortunately, I found that running seemed to be aggravating the injury, so I decided to take the rest of the week off and hopfully that would give enough time for the shoulder to recover.
