The week started off pretty well, then went to hell in a handbasket!. I ended up combining each of the planned double runs on Monday and Thursday into single longer runs, but I still covered the planned distance those days. Time contraints on Tuesday forced me to shorten the morning run, and I had planned to make it up with a longer run in the afternoon, but work got in the way and I didn't get out for that run at all. By Friday, though, I found myself exhausted and overly sore, so I ended up skipping both of the Friday runs and the Saturday run in hopes of getting some extra rest and recouperation time.

As the days get shorter, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to manage two runs per day while there's decent light. I've rejigged the schedule for the upcoming few weeks to run once per day, doing 7K on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons and keeping with the early morning longer runs (10K) on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday while Maggie is at swim practice.
