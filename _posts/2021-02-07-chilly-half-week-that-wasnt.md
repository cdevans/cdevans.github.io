#### Run Log

- Tue: 5K tempo ==> 5.02K @ 9:04 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1680331311))

I struggled through the entire Tuesday run - my legs were sore and feeling like lead, and my right hip was aching. I woke up Wednesday to quite a bit of pain in the hip, so I decided to take a couple days off and re-evaluate on the weekend. Since I was still experiencing a fair bit of hip pain on Saturday, I opted to forego the weekend runs as well. Hopefully, all will right (enough) again to continue next week. I plan to shift everything out by one week (a nice side effect of targetting a virtual race that can be run any time!) and tackle the originally scheduled Week 11 again next week.

#### Total Distance: 5.02K
