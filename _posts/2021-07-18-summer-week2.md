I finally managed to get back to a full-distance training week, although it was not exactly as planned. Due to high humidity and torrential rain, I had to skip the Tuesday afteroon run (5K 5&1), and I had to shorten the Thursday afternoon run (5K 5&1) because I was feeling pretty tired. However, on Friday morning, I swapped the runs, which allowed me to make up the missed Thursday distance, and I even pre-emptively added extra distance as well, since it was Quinn's birthday and our dinner plans meant I was likely going to miss the afternoon run (which I ultimately did). However, I made up most of the remaining missed distance on Saturday, and then did an LSD run on Sunday. I had planned to go 10K on Sunday, but at the 5K mark my legs were feeling pretty tired and sore, so I turned around early and ended up only putting in 7K.
