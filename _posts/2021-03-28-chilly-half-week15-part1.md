Postponing last week's long run until Monday really messed me up for this week. I had planned to push the weekday runs by a day and take Tuesday off, but ended up taking a second day due to weather and work schedule. So, I did a combination on Thursday, first the Wednesday (4K fartlek) run immediately followed by the Tuesday (6K tempo) run. Unfortuantely, I could not get a good pace going in either of them.

Poor weather and lingering hip pain made me decide to take the rest of the week off and re-do this training week in its entirety next week.
