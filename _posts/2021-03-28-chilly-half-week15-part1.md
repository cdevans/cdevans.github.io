#### Run Log

- Thu: 4K farlek (as 1min fast, 2min steady) + 6K tempo ==> 4.02K @ 8:25 + 6.16K @ 9:39 ([Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1713348693) [Log](https://runkeeper.com/user/cdevans/activity/1713379686))

Postponing last week's long run until Monday really messed me up for this week. I had planned to push the weekday runs by a day and take Tuesday off, but ended up taking a second day off due to weather and schedule. So, I did a combination on Thursday, first the Wednesday (4K fartlek) run immediately followed by the Tuesday (6K tempo) run. Unfortuantely, I could not get a good pace going in either of them.

Poor weather and lingering hip pain made me decide to take the rest of the week off and re-do this training week in its entirety next week.

#### Total Distance: 10.18K
