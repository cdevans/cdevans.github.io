The first full week of summer didn't go exactly as planned. I had hoped to get back to a full schedule this week, but life, work, and weather all conspired against that happening! I missed the Tuesday afternoon run (5K 5&1) due to extreme humidity, and both of the Thursday (4K fartlek and 5K 5&1) runs due to heavy rain. While I don't mind running in the rain, this was a particularly bad weather week, with periods of really heavy rain! I had too much happening on Friday and over the weekend to get out for the Friday afternoon run (5K 5&1) or the weekend long run (10K LSD). Hopefully next week will be better.
