Not a great week for training due to snow and slushy road conditions. Missed Tuesday (5K tempo) and Wednesday (3K tempo), but ran some extra on Thursday. Really struggled with the last couple kilometers of the long run. Probably shouldn't have skipped so many runs this week!

#### Total Distance: 21.29K
