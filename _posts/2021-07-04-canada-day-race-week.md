The heat and humidity spilled over into the early parts of this week. Combined with a fairly busy few days work-wise, this meant no running until Thursday.

I did my 10K virtual race on Canada Day, though. In restrospect, this was an ambitious decision given that I've gone two full weeks without any runs! That said, I finished the distance, just at a slower pace than I'd been hoping to achieve.

On Friday, I set out at a faster pace than I had intended, so I decided to keep it up and see how far I could manage. For the most part, I was able to hold the increased pace for 4K, which was a pleasant surprise.

Saturday morning, I woke up feeling quite sore, so I took the weekend off and will get back to a full schedule next week.

While I obviously didn't make a lot of progress towards my distance goal this week, thanks to many generous donations I have raised nearly half of my fundraising goal! Thank you so much for all the support.
