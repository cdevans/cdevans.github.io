The week went reasonably well. I missed the Wednesday PM run to take Quinn for his first vaccine shot, and the Thursday PM run in order to get groceries, but made up some of the distance in each of the Friday runs. I also split the longer weekend run over both days, so that two shorter distances could be done and there would still be ample time in each day to get out for a family bike ride.
